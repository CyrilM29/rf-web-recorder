# AGENTS.md

Default to concise responses: lead with the conclusion, dense bullet points, no preamble or filler, except for critical security, ambiguity needing clarification, or learning contexts.

Condensed guide for AI coding assistants working on **rf-web-recorder**
(universal web test recorder emitting Robot Framework code for the Browser
library: see `README.md` / `README.fr.md`, kept bilingual with cross-link
banners). Respond to the user in French; code, keyword names and identifiers
stay in English. Sibling of the SAPFX project (`E:\QA_GenAI\SAP_library_custom`)
its generic dom engine was ported from there (attribution in `NOTICE`).

Never use the em dash (« — ») anywhere in this repo (docs, READMEs, specs,
docstrings, comments, emitted strings, workflows, config): use a colon, a
comma, parentheses, or split the sentence (French puts a space before the
colon, English does not). Enforced by `tools/check-no-em-dash.mjs`, run by `npm test`.

## Observe, do not fix

When a test run fails (red test, accessibility violation, baseline or snapshot
drift, regression): report the finding (file, screen or page, rule, impact,
useful output) and stop there. Do not fix the application under test, and do
not fix the test itself either, without an explicit request.

- No convenience baseline update, no `--update-snapshots` to turn a suite green.
- Healer agents run only on request.
- When unsure whether to observe or fix: observe, then ask.
- Exception: a fix that was explicitly asked for, or the development work in
  progress on this repo, is delivered in full, as usual.

## Memory (three coexisting layers)

1. **Project memory (this repo, public-safe)**: `memory/` at the repo root,
   anonymized durable project facts (no personal data, no machine paths, no
   private URLs); index `memory/MEMORY.md`, rules in `memory/README.md`.
2. **Private cross-project base**: `E:\QA_GenAI\agent-memory\`, user
   profile/preferences, machine specifics, cross-project facts, research
   notes; contract in its `PROTOCOLE.md`. Never published.
3. **Claude Code auto-memory** (Claude only): internal pointers, no
   duplication of the other layers.

Read both indexes at session start. New fact: publishable + project-specific
→ layer 1; personal/machine/cross-project → layer 2. One fact per file,
update the index in the same operation, never secrets anywhere.
